3D FALLING SAND

Tested on Windows 7, with an ATI Radeon HD4850.

To run, simply run sandish.exe. If all resources are located properly, it
should work. One problem I've come across is that on some computers, it seems
to have trouble locating main.lua. I was unable to determine why this would
happen (works fine on many computers, the files were present, etc etc). Also
due to some differences in OpenGL implementations, I saw some issues running on
Nvidia cards. I think all of those issues have been resolved.

Once the program starts, you should see a floor. This marks the bottom of the
cube. Use the WASD keys to move the camera. Use the mouse to look around. If
you move closer to the cube, you should see a floating cube appear. This is
your cursor. When you click, cubes will be added to the simulation at the
cursor.

By default, you'll add sand. To change the current cube type, press the keys
1-4.

  1 sand
  2 water
  3 concrete
  4 worker
